BTest is a Web App for analyzing blood tests. The user uploads his blood test to the system and receives a complete decipherment in Hebrew, including tips. The system crosses between the user's blood test and his behavior patterns and finds connections between a measure that is not within the normal range and an incorrect behavior pattern and thus improves the user's life.

Built-in React, React-Context C# .Net, and SQL.
